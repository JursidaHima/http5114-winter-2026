    <h1>GitHub for Individuals</h1>
    
  <p>
    GitHub is one of the most popular and important development tools you will use. 
   It keeps a history of your development activity and can be used as a tool to show potential employers your code and coding habits.
   GitHub can also be used to help multiple developers work on the same code set without overwriting each other’s additions. 
   However, this task will focus on using the tool as an individual. In this task you will use GitHub to:
     <ul>
      <li>Store and share your code</li>
      <li>Create backups and version control</li>
      <li>Practice using the Git and GitHub CLI</li>
     </ul>
  Remember that Git and GitHub are two different things. Just like Gmail is one of many providers of email. 
  GitHub is one of many providers for storing Git repositories.
  Git and GitHub can be hard at first. And if you haave never used the Command Line, it can be a bit intimidating. However, it might be the most important and widely used development tool.
